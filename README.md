# Academic Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects from my undergraduate studies, showcasing various computer science concepts and problem-solving approaches. Each folder represents a self-contained project, highlighting different aspects of programming, algorithm design, and software development.

## Current Projects

### 1. [Password Cypher](https://github.com/DariusDahl/academic-mini-projects/blob/main/password-cypher/)
- **Overview**: A series of programs written in C to demonstrate principles of cryptography through encoding, decoding, and breaking a simple cyphertext. The project explores modular arithmetic, frequency analysis, and implementation of algorithms to manipulate textual input.
- **Learning Goals**:
  - Understand the mechanics behind encoding and decoding algorithms.
  - Implement techniques for analyzing cyphertexts to deduce the encryption key.
  - Gain experience in handling user input and working with character data programmatically.

### 2. [Einstein Solid Multiplicity Calculator](https://github.com/DariusDahl/academic-mini-projects/blob/main/statmech-physics/)
- **Overview**: A Python program analyzing statistical mechanics in coupled Einstein solids. It calculates the multiplicity and probability distribution of macrostates given the number of atoms and total energy.
- **Learning Goals**:
  - Translate mathematical physics models into efficient code.
  - Handle large combinatorial calculations and factorials.
  - Demonstrate probability normalization and structured tabular outputs.
  - Explore computational limits in factorial-heavy models.
